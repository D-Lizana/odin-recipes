        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Ajarski khachapuri is a boat-shaped Georgian bread with a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center.</p> 
        <P>It's only a matter of time before this fun bread is delivered to every home for pizza night and ordered from every brunch menu the morning after.</p>

        <p>This versatile bread takes a little finesse, but the payoff is well worth it; after all, what more could you want other than cheesy, soft, chewy
        bread dipped in runny yolk and molten cheese?</p>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Make dough: Combine milk, water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl.</p> 
                <p>Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</p> 
                <P>Add 2 cups flour, olive oil, and salt; mix until a sticky dough forms.</p>
                <p> </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Turn dough out onto a floured surface.</p>
                <p>Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in remaining 1/4 cup flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable.</p>
                <p>Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl.</p>
                <p>Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</p>
                <p> </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</p>
                <p> </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>While dough rises, prepare cheese blend: Toss together feta, Monterey Jack, and mozzarella cheese in a medium bowl.</p>
                <p>Refrigerate cheese mixture until needed.</p>
                <p> </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface.</p>
                <p>Flatten slightly and cut in half.</p>
                <p>Place 1 dough half on a sheet of parchment paper dusted with flour.</p>
                <p>Roll out into a rectangle about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.</p>
                <p> </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Arrange 1/4 of the cheese mixture in 2 rows, 1 to 2 inches from the longest sides.</p>
                <p>Roll sides up tightly over cheese, forming a canoe shape. </p>
                <p>Pinch and twist ends to seal.</p>
                <p>Trim excess parchment and lift dough onto a baking sheet.</p>
                <p>Shape and stuff remaining dough half.</p>
                <p>Fill canoes with remaining cheese mixture.</p>
                <p> </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. </p>
                <p>Form a well in the center of each khachapuri using a spoon; crack an egg inside each well.</p>
                <p> </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Return to the oven and bake until eggs are mostly set, 3 to 4 minutes. </p>
                <p>Place 2 pats butter over each egg, then sprinkle with salt and cayenne. </p>
                <p> Plate khachapuri; tear off one end and use it to stir butter into egg.</p>
                <p> </p>
            </li>

        </ol>
